Thank you for looking at my TAS simulator.

TAS stands for "Transmission Assessment Survey," the current methodology employed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine
whether the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in an evaluation area (EA) has dropped below a certain threshold. This methodology
has been in use for almost a decade but there has been some debate on its effectiveness.

Our simulation allows a user to create an EA with control over various demographic and disease conditions and explore the resulting
decisions TAS would generate under three different decision-making methods. Our paper uses an example scenario from the WHO's 
guidelines on LF elimination as a framework for demonstrating the simulator in action and comparing the three different approaches
for pass/failure.
